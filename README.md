# Stock Management Software
Created portfolios with strong, well managed companies and analyzed graphs to follow the statues of these companies. This stock exchange game gave us the first-hand experience of real-time stock market trading., and the process of analysing data. We calculated the average percentage change in the stock prices in each portfolio, to better be able to pick investment choices. We also learnt that the Stock Exchange has a main role in the economy as it mobilizes money, contributes capital, etc.
The future scope of this would be to become a real time trading application. The program would also include a live stream of news related to relevant stocks on the userâ€™s portfolio to better plot the trend of the market and help the user make better decisions.
